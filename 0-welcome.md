# CSE 212 - Programming with Data Structures Final Project

Welcome to my CSE 212 Final! For this project I was tasked with making 3 little tutorials based around data structures in Python. The following are the ones I've chosen:

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Sets](2-set.md)
- [Binary Search Trees](3-tree.md)

Each section will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each topic you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first. But, what am I gonna do? Stop you? I'm just a markdown file, I'm not a cop. I have no real power here.
